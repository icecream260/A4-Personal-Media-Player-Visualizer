# About the Media Player
Welcome to Ginger Island! In this media player, we have the Ginger Island theme song from the game "Stardew Valley." There are three main features from the game that have been added! The first is Willy’s boat, which moves back and forth on the water, taking us from Pelican Town to the island. The second is the Blue Discus fish, one of the island’s cutest fish, used as an icon on the progress bar while the song is playing. The third is the giant volcano, emitting smoke into the air, just like Ginger Island’s volcano.

# Interactive Features
Volcano: The volcano continuously emits smoke into the air and the intensity of the smoke changes based on the music’s bass and volume. For example, when the bass/volume is loud, the smoke becomes larger and when the bass/volume is lower, the smoke becomes smaller. Another interactive feature is with the mouse cursor. Moving the mouse through the smoke pushes it around.

Willy's Boat: The boat moves back and forth in and out of the frame. If the mouse cursor is placed in front of the boat, it stops moving until the cursor is moved away.

Progression Bar: When the mouse hovers over the fish, it increases in size and it decreases when not hovering.

Play Button: You can press play or pause the music.

Volume Bar: You can adjust the volume of the song and the displayed volume percentage changes accordingly.

# Waveform/Spectrum
Spectrum (fft.analyze): Rather than the default single-sided frequency bars, there are two sets of bars mirrored side by side, roughly matching the shape of the volcano as the music plays. The bars are green to represent the trees on the island, emphasizing the nature theme.

Waveform (fft.waveform): Instead of a straight waveform line in the middle of the frame, I turned it into a circular waveform to represent the sun in the top-right corner. I also added clouds by creating another set of waveforms shaped as ellipses that move back and forth. As the music plays, both the sun and clouds react to the amplitude of the song.
